## Random Password Generator
## Description
The goal of this project was to use Javascript to create a random password generator based on user inputs. Using pseudo code, I laid out a series of if/else statments that would ask the user for an input as well what characters they wanted included in their password. The password to be generated is then set to a lowercase default, and then concatenated with user selections based on window prompts.

During this project I learned and applied a lot of Javascript. This included setting global and local variables, arrays, functions, if and if/else statements. Additionally I learned how to sort use built in js functions such as math.floor and math.random. 

## Usage
To use the password generator- "click" generate password and follow instructions on the prompts. Use 'Ok' for yes or 'Cancel' for no.
